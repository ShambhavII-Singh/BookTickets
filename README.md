# Travel App
This is a simple four screen application to mimic the UI of a typical ticket booking app. A customer can view available hotels and search for tickets and hotels. They can also view upcoming and previous ticket in detail. Each customer also has their own personalized profile page. The application has reusable widgets and components that are deployed dynamically. Right now, this application does not have a backend.
